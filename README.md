# SigNet
SigNet (Detecting Signature Similarity using Machine Learning/Deep Learning): Is this the end of Human Forensic Analysis?
My grandfather was an expert in handwriting analysis. He spent all his life analyzing documents for the CBI (Central Bureau Of Investigation). His unique way of analyzing documents using a magnifying glass and different tools required huge amounts of time and patience to analyze a single document. This is back when computers were not fast enough. I remember vividly that he photocopied the same document multiple times and arranged it on the table to gain a closer look at the handwriting style.

# How
To build our Signature Similarity network, we will use utilize the wonders of Deep Learning. We will go through three approaches to extract the similarity between our handwritten signatures. For our initial data, we will use the HandWritten Signatures dataset from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/divyanshrai/handwritten-signatures)

For this project we will require:
- Python 3.8: The Programming Language
- TensorFlow 2: The Deep Learning Library
- Numpy: Linear Algebra
- Matplotlib: Plotting imagesÂ 
- Scikit-Learn: General Machine Learning Library
